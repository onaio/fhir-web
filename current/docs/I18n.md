# Multi-language Support (MLS)

OpenSRP Web supports multi-language using [react.i18next](https://react.i18next.com/). This document is divided into 2 sections

1. Usage - contains instructions on how people can configure MLS when using packages.
2. Contributors - Targets developers with the intent of either adding packages that should support MlS or maintaining packages that already support MLS

## Usage

Install the i18n and pkg-config packages.

```sh
yarn add @opensrp/i18n @opensrp/pkg-config
```

Pass the required configs to pkg-config at the earliest point possible in your code. This should be before you import any other @opensrp packages

```typescript
// dispatch-configs.ts
import { setAllConfigs } from '@opensrp/pkg-config';

setAllConfigs({
  languageCode: 'en',
  projectCode: 'core',
});
```

```typescript
// index.js
import './dispatch-configs';
import
```

**Configuration**

Opensrp-web packages uses 2 configuration options to fully configure MLS i.e. `languageCode` and `projectCode`. These 2 are the subtags that we use to form a languageTag which is formatted as `<languageCode>-<projectCode>`. They are supplied once during build, via the envs `REACT_APP_LANGUAGE_CODE` and `REACT_APP_PROJECT_CODE`.

**N/B** The language should be internally available in the package of interest. If you are not sure of this check the [Adding a new language section](#adding-a-new-language)

consider where you have a certain string e.g. `Plans` that should translate to `Plans` for a certain clinet instance but display as `Missions` in another instance of the same app. In other words how can we support different translation values for the same language

This is where the `projectCode` comes in, helps further define what set of translations for a certain language should be used

## Contributors/Maintainers

This section targets developers interested in enhancing, supporting or maintaining MLS-enabled packages.

### MLS architecture

The `@opensrp/i18n` package includes the translation resources as static strings, it also exposes an [i18n](github.com/i18next/) instance that is
preloaded with the string resources and a context provider that provisions the `i18n` instance to your render tree. The `i18n` package relies on
`@opensrp/pkg-config` to get the initial configured language.

### Adding translatable strings

To Update the translateable strings:

Check that the strings are wrapped by a the `i18next` translator function `t`.
Run the string extraction command.

```sh
./scripts/i18nExtraction.js extract <package-folder-names...> -l <locales...>
```

e.g

```sh
# in the repo root directory
./scripts/i18nExtraction.js extract app react-utils -l en sw
```

This should parse the code, get all translatable strings and updated the respective json locale files in `packages/i18n`.
From here, you can use your favourite translation tools to get the translations as json files, add them to the right folders in `packages/i18n`,
and then shoot us a PR.

### Adding a Localized package

To add a package with localization support, you only need 2 things.

1. the new package should have a peerDependency on the `@opensrp/i18n` package
2. Add a `src/mls.ts` file with the below content.

```typescript
import { useTranslation as useOrigTranslation, UseTranslationOptions } from '@opensrp/i18n';

export const namespace = '<package-folder-name>';

export const useTranslation = (ns?: string, options?: UseTranslationOptions) => {
  return useOrigTranslation(ns ? ns : namespace, options);
};
```

This hook abstraction helps add the namespace scope to the `@opensrp/i18n.useTranslation` , the alternative would require you to pass the namespace to every useTranslation call in a package.

## Adding a new language

Add it to `@openspr/pkg-config` for proper typing.

```typescipt
export const supportedLanguageCodes = ['en', 'sw', 'fr', 'ar', 'th', 'vi'] as const;
export const supportedProjectCode = ['eusm', 'core'] as const;
```

Then run the extraction command while necessary locale or/and the projectCode options.

```sh
# in the repo root directory
./scripts/i18nExtraction.js extract  -l <new-locale> -p <projectCode>
```

This should update the locales files in packages/i18n. Create a pr.
