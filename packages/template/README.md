### Props/ Configuration

#### linkerField

_Optional_(`string` | `undefined` = `undefined`)

When the table is rendered, you can click anywhere on a row to drill down to the next level of the hierarchy. However, you may want to display some kind of indication that it is possible to drill down on a row of data. The `linkerField` prop allows you to define which field should have this indicator. By default this is set to the `id` field.
