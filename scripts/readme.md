# scripts

Home of tiny bespoke and lightweight utility code that automates common code maintenance and shipping tasks.

These include:

1. i18n : cli utility that one can use to manage internationalization tasks on the repository
2. helm-envs-checker : cli utility that checks envs disparity across web, express and our official helm chart
